todo

fitness function for both role and forage pattern (exploit/explore)

a(food/time) + b(babies/time)

sum fitness / num ants

pick random from better half of colony

min values have their own parameters

heatmap for histogram.
histogram on its height. 3d-ish

generation count.
----------------
graph for min/avg/max generation

toggle gene scaling
<.5
gene scaling p(forage) = gene^2 * 2
p(breed) = 1 - p(forage)

>.5
p(breed) = (1-gene)^2 * 2
p(forage) = 1-p(breed)

same for exploit/explore
and other stats

breeding condition toggle
------------------------------
toggle benefits/drawback of gene

make sure that total food in environment is equal. have a parameter to set value
